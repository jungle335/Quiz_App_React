## Quiz App
My React App Project represents a quiz app, where you can create
your own quiz to be solved by everyone who has an account in the
app.

<b>The app routes</b>

- /log-into - log in application
- /new-acc - register an account
- /about - the user page that consists of some basic options such as editing or delete the account, delete a quiz and so forth.
- /search - the page where there are shown all users together with their created quizzes.
- /... - (here ... means every inexistent or wrong route) it is shown the not found page
